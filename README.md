# Twitter Scraping Python code

### Program Description

I built a program to scrape the authors of specific tweets and identify their individual follower counts. See below for the step by step process:

  1. First, I installed Beautiful Soup and Selenium WebDriver. 
  2. Next, I built a web scraper to scrape tweets bearing the hashtag #MacMiller. I assembled the first ten tweets for later use in a DataFrame. Note: the scraper is built such that the variable and DataFrame where the tweets are stored can handle more than 10 tweets if need be.
  3. Lastly, I built a scraper that would access my 'Authors' DataFrame, plug that name into a twitter search bar, identify their twitter page and scrape the number of followers each twitter account had. In this example, Complex Music had the greatest number of followers with 1.4 Million
  
 This was one of my first programs I built that encompassed the use of Web scraping along with Twitter.
 
 Enjoy!
